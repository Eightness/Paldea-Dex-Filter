# paldea-dex-filter

Since the release of the new Pokemon games Scarlet and Violet, I wanted to make a program to help me filter through the 400 pokemon available.

The idea is to filter by stats, types and names (also abilities in the future).

Also a feature to build a team, having access to all the related information.
